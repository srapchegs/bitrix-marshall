	 Bad Touch are a 5-piece classic rock band from Norfolk, UK. Most people see growing up in Norfolk as a disadvantage, but Bad Touch owe the core of their sound to their countryside surroundings. Those formative years of listening to the likes of Led Zeppelin, The Black Crowes, Free and Lynyrd Skynyrd whilst looking out on the rolling countryside and hard-working people gave them an escape to help create their infectious blend of rock, country and blues.

	 After signing to Marshall Records in 2018, Bad Touch released third album ‘Shake A Leg’ which featured Planet Rock Radio favourites ‘Lift Your Head Up’ and ‘Too Many Times’ and critical acclaim across the board and built upon the reputation the band had cemented with tracks like their duet with Mollie Marriott, a cover of Ike &amp; Tina Turner’s classic ‘Baby Get It on’ and crowd pleaser ‘99%’ from 2016’s ‘Truth Be Told’.
